Boilerplate for React apps
=====================================

This is a boilerplate app that I started using the new create-react-app NPM module. I extended this to include a variety of other components.

* Added a new src/components directory to add a bit more organization
* Using a simple Bootstrap layout, I broke the HTML into separate React components that could be reused
* Ran "npm install react-router-dom" to include this wrapper for react-router to handle the route/view transitions
* Added the use of fetch to consume a REST API endpoint
* Added "proxy": "http://localhost:3001" to the end of the package.json file as a reference to a REST API.
* `react-scripts` is a development dependency in the generated projects (including this one).
